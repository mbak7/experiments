# experiments

Hello everyone,

    My name is Michal and I am interested in building experiments that actually work! I have been using OpenSesame a little but am currently tackling a project that is too big for me. I decided to turn to the world of github and hope to learn as much as I can. In the future, I hope that I can help others in the github community.
